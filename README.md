## üè• Hospital Management System
**HospitalMS** is an administration system for hospitals and medical centers developed by ITCR students. This repository holds all of HospitalMS's open source projects that lived in their own separate Github repos: frontend and server. Built with Angular, NestJS, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.</break>
We are working to offer a system that makes usability simple, it is specifically designed for the TEC clinic requirements but can be scalable to any Hospital. **Hospital Management System wants patient care to be the only thing you need to worry about!**
